# beerpwn cyber security team

Capturing the flags since the 2018, 1 flag - 1 beer!  
We are friends who met at the university and passionate about hacking, from Turin, Italy.  
We work as penetration tester.

Official site: [beerpwn.it](http://beerpwn.it/)

In this repository you can find a collection of CTF writeups, of challenges and of Boot-to-Root machines.  
The details about CVEs that have been assigned to us were moved [here](https://github.com/beerpwn/CVE) ;)
